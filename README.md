Jitsi Security Tests

Just some random tests I'm performing to Jitsi...
For the time being, created a script that can simulate a connection to Jitsi's XMPP server to either join or create a new room and set a password on it.

To use it, simply edit the top parameters on simulate.sh:
HOSTNAME="meet.jit.si"
MEETINGROOM="testmeeting15"
NICKNAME="Evil dude"
ROOMSECRET="segredo"

...and run the script!
